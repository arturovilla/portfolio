            I am a graduate of the Texas A&M College of Engineering with a degree in computer science and a minor in statistics, with a concentration in data science. I come from a solid technical background with a strong interest in statistics and a passion for new technologies. My focus and interests vary from machine learning to web-development and graphic design.

            As a freelance software engineer I like taking on projects in industries that one would not necessarily think about. Fashion, art, product design, and e-commerce are all things I have an interest in and am working towards getting to know more about.
