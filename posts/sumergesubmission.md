### Artist Statement

I’m a Houston-based digital artist and software engineer with a deep interest in the expressive potential of shaders and real-time graphics. My work explores the fundamental building blocks of computer graphics—shaders—and how these simple, low-level programs can be orchestrated into complex, emotionally resonant visual systems. What draws me to this medium is its boundless flexibility; shaders are often seen as technical tools, but I see them as digital paintbrushes that respond, evolve, and react to the world around them.

Recently, I’ve been inspired by the nostalgia of early digital interfaces—particularly the music visualizers from Windows XP. Despite their simplicity, those reactive visuals captured something deeply human: a computer responding to sound in a way that felt alive. My practice builds on that idea, creating immersive shader-based experiences that reflect the computer’s point of view—how it might see, hear, and feel music or other stimuli.

Beyond simple audio reactivity, I’m currently exploring how shaders can interact with one another, forming networks of visual logic that feel more like digital ecosystems than isolated effects. These interdependent systems allow for emergent behaviors, where one shader’s movement or rhythm influences another, opening the door to deeper forms of generative storytelling and visual dialogue.

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between technical precision and emotional expression, using the raw tools of software and computation to create visual environments that pulse with life and respond in real time—much like we do. SUBMERGE represents the perfect platform to bring these explorations off the screen and into a physical, immersive space.
