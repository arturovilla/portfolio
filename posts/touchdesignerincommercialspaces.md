### Background

Over the past few months i have been working as a Creative developer for [Art-Club]() in Houston TX. Art Club is a cross between a museum and a nightclub;
during the day the hundreds of people that go to [POST Houston]() to work, eat, and shop have access to over 10 large new media art exhibits created by artists from all over the world and they all have a different vibe.

Some deal with lasers and lights and can be enjoyed while sitting down while others are as big a warehouse and take a bit of time to fully experience.

In addition to all of the art installations, Art-Club also has a preformance venue which will be the focus of this post. (I could write an entire post for each installation lol)

### Technicals

The Art Club Club Room is a roughly 100x125ft box with ten 1200x900 LED-walls suspended from the ceiling, 8 programmable high output rgb lasers, and around 32 over RBGLED spot lights, also programmable. All of this equipment is controlled by 3 computers running seperate instances of TouchDesigner communicating via the local network. It is an impressive, complicated, and really incredible room that i get to use as a canvas when programming and designing my own visuals.

While you really should go see for yourself, here is a really cheap and rough 3d mockup i made to give you an idea.

The LED walls in the club room is half spectical and half art installation. All 10 screens are controlled via touch designer and that means that as a designer myself, i have to program my visuals with not only audio reactivity but with relativity as well.
A good visual will not be really bright on the left side of the room, and completely black on the other side. This was a challenge at first, but over time ive tuned my visuals to be more encompassing of the entire canvas.

Below is a gif of one such visual, you can also view it on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TouchDesigner/comments/1mt7dsw/is_this_giving_a_dia_de_los_muertos_vibe/).

The big square represents one screen , and the 10 seemingly random images to the right represent the 10 different screens in the space. Each one offset by a quarter of a seconds to provide some more dynamic and random visual interest.

I wanted to highlight this becuase in these past few months the way i think has definitly changed, i have been able to "think" in 3D and visualize in my head what the resultant image will look like in the 3D space like the Club Room at Art-Club.

### Commercial Work

I think when i started this hourney i was pretty shocked at the price for a commercial liscense of TouchDesigner. At the time of writing is $600.

But after working and experimenting with the software at home and whn preforming at Art-Club, the price is well worth it in my opinion.

Even now im starting to see its use everywhere. From huge live preformaces to small retail experiences as part of some ad campaign, This software is really something and i fear ive only really scratched the surface of what can be done.
